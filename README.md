# FormFlow

FormFlow is a multi-step form application designed for real-time collaboration and enhanced user experience. The project leverages modern frontend technologies such as Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Zustand/Redux (or Context API), ShadCN UI, and Framer Motion to deliver a polished and responsive application.

## Features

1. **Multi-Step Form Navigation**:
   - Seamless navigation through form steps.
   - Visual progress tracking using ShadCN’s Progress component or a custom-built solution.

2. **Dynamic State Management**:
   - Utilizes Zustand/Redux or Context API for managing form data across steps.
   - Persistent state that updates dynamically as users fill out the form.

3. **Real-Time Collaboration**:
   - Mock API integration with Next.js API routes to simulate real-time updates.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
   - Full support for dark mode with Tailwind CSS.

5. **Enhanced UI/UX**:
   - Smooth animations with Framer Motion.
   - Tooltips, placeholders, and toast notifications for better user guidance.

6. **Accessibility & Localization**:
   - WCAG-compliant design with keyboard navigation and ARIA roles.
   - Optional multi-language support via next-i18next.
